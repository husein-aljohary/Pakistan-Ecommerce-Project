# Pakistan-Ecommerce-Project

### About Dataset

This is the largest retail e-commerce orders dataset from Pakistan.<br>
It contains half a million transaction records from March 2016 to August 2018.<br>
The data was collected from various e-commerce merchants as part of a research study.<br> 
There is a dire need for such dataset to learn about Pakistan’s emerging e-commerce potential.

### Objectives
Through this analysis and tableau dashboard,<br>
we will be able to answer these questions:<br><br>
• What is the best-selling category?<br>
• Visualize payment method and order status frequency<br>
• Find a correlation between payment method and order status<br>
• Find a correlation between order date and item category<br>
• Find any hidden patterns that are counter-intuitive for a layman<br>
• Can we predict number of orders, or item category or number of customers/amount in advance?
